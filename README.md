# Reporting-Engine For Azure Workloads

------ This engine is focussed to take data from Microsoft Intune and generate Power BI reports from the data. The whole engine can work in a virtual machine, so, if you want the reports available to you... they will be available every morning without even clicking. This is very handy to pick out bugs and malwares in an enterprise system, and since Power BI is still improving, so the project will get a lot better in future.

------ There are two sets of scripts in the Repository, one is for first time installation, and the other one can be used for future, since the whole program is automated, so necessary changes to be done in the code are indicated by comments.

------- All the scripts are in PowerShell.
